# Install

1. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`

    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:kev-bi/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

    Update any submodules if needed

    ```
    git submodule update --remote
    ```

2. Run the install script (possibly you will need to run this command twice after ZSH install?)

    ```
    cd ~/.dotfiles && source install.sh
    ```

    Pass the following flag to install the packages in the Brewfile
    ```
    -bf|--brewfile
    ```

    Pass the following flag along with email to set up an ssh-key on the machine
    ```
    -sk|--ssh-keygen "your_email@example.com"
    ```

3. [Generate](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) a new ssh key if you didn't pass the `-sk` or `--ssh-key` flag in the previous step

4. [Add](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) the new ssh key to your github account

# Troubleshooting

## brew install gcc

When installing gcc with brew there is a possibility you will get the following error:

```
Warning: The post-install step did not complete successfully
You can try again using:
  brew postinstall gcc
```

In this case you will need to follow these directions to install some additional [requirements](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux#requirements). Then ` brew postinstall gcc` should work.
